        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Shelton Ngomakapile, a final-year Management Science student at Stellenbosch University, specializing in Information Systems and Business Analytics. My passion for web development ignited during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I've since been immersed in creating innovative web solutions and mastering data analytics.</p>
        <p>Driven by a love for art and fashion, I infuse creativity into my technical projects, aiming to craft websites that are both visually striking and highly functional. My goal is to seamlessly integrate data analytics with web development, bringing data-driven insights to life through dynamic and engaging web experiences.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you might find me hiking, running, or hitting the gym. As a student leader, I embrace opportunities to contribute to my community while continually learning and growing. I'm excited about the future and eager to make a meaningful impact through technology. Thanks for visiting my portfolioâ€”I look forward to connecting with you!</p>

                <h3>StelStay Properties</h3>
                <p>StelStay Properties Information System is a student accommodation management application developed by SBSJ Technologies. This project was part of my curriculum last year, where we utilized React Admin and Vite, with Pocketbase for the backend. The system focuses on simplifying the lease application process and efficient rent invoicing. Key features include a lease application process where students can apply for accommodation and administrators manage applications for approval and room assignment, and a rent invoicing feature that generates and manages monthly rent invoices, ensuring a smooth payment process. Group members included Joshua Sayers, Bafana Madume, Scott Stewart, and myself.</p>

                <p>This is a personal project where I developed a concept thrift website using simple HTML and CSS. The website features a clean and functional layout, showcasing my ability to create a visually appealing and user-friendly web page. The project highlights my skills in front-end development and my approach to designing functional web interfaces.</p>
